# ERP Web Client – Phase 3.6 (Operational Forms + UX)
Date: 2025-12-26

## What improved (focus on operations)
- Replaced JSON payload editors with real forms (Job Orders, Invoice Full, Inventory Transfer Flow)
- Added Toast notifications (success/error)
- Inventory uses lookups from backend (stores/items) when available

Users & permissions are deferred (per agreement).

## Setup
```bash
npm i
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```
